This repo maintains sayings that are constantly spoken by the wise `cow-cronner` and `whale-cronner` every single day.

To be frank, I'd stick to my greens since being eco-friendly is the way, and I hate it when the white-topping on a profile broadens the gap on a possible future oppurtunity.

With that in mind , check out the indefinite number of sayings as mentioned by the *cow-cronner* and the *whale-cronner* below :-
