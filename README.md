/ No one likes us. I don't know why. We   \
| may not be perfect, We give them money, |
| But heaven knows we try. But are they   |
| grateful? But all around, No, they're   |
| spiteful, Even our old friends put us   |
| down. And they're hateful. Let's drop   |
| the big one, They don't respect us, And |
| see what happens. So let's surprise     |
| them                                    |
|                                         |
| We'll drop the big one,                 |
|                                         |
| And pulverize 'em. Asia's crowded,      |
| Europe's too old, Africa is far too     |
| hot, We'll save Australia. And Canada's |
| too cold. Don't wanna hurt no           |
| kangaroos. And South America stole our  |
| name We'll build an All-American        |
| amusement Let's drop the big one, park  |
| there-- There'll be no one left to      |
| blame us. They got surfin', too!        |
|                                         |
| Boom! goes London, And Boom! Paree.     |
| More room for you, Oh, how peaceful     |
| it'll be! And more room for me, We'll   |
| set everybody free! And every city,     |
| You'll wear a Japanese kimono, babe;    |
| The whole world round, There'll be      |
| Italian shoes for me! Will just be      |
| another American town. They all hate us |
| anyhow,                                 |
|                                         |
| So, let's drop the big one now.         |
|                                         |
| Let's drop the big one now!             |
