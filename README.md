/ A couple of young fellers were fishing  \
| at their special pond off the beaten    |
| track when out of the bushes jumped the |
| Game Warden. Immediately, one of the    |
| boys threw his rod down and started     |
| running through the woods like the      |
| proverbial bat out of hell, and hot on  |
| his heels ran the Game Warden. After    |
| about a half mile the fella stopped and |
| stooped over with his hands on his      |
| thighs, whooping and heaving to catch   |
| his breath as the Game Warden finally   |
| caught up to him.                       |
|                                         |
| "Let's see yer fishin' license, boy,"   |
| the Warden gasped. The man pulled out   |
| his wallet and gave the Game Warden a   |
| valid fishing license.                  |
|                                         |
| "Well, son", snarled the Game Warden,   |
| "You must be about as dumb as a box of  |
| rocks! You didn't have to run if you    |
| have a license!"                        |
|                                         |
| "Yes, sir," replied his victim, "but,   |
| well, see, my friend back there, he     |
\ don't have one!"                        /

/ When I drink, *everybody* drinks!" a   \
