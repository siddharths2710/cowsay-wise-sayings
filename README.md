/ As the system comes up, the component   \
| builders will from time to time appear, |
| bearing hot new versions of their       |
| pieces -- faster, smaller, more         |
| complete, or putatively less buggy. The |
| replacement of a working component by a |
| new version requires the same           |
| systematic testing procedure that       |
| adding a new component does, although   |
| it should require less time, for more   |
| complete and efficient test cases will  |
| usually be available.                   |
