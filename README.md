/ I always will remember -- I was in no   \
| mood to trifle; 'Twas a year ago        |
| November -- I got down my trusty rifle  |
| I went out to shoot some deer And went  |
| out to stalk my prey -- On a morning    |
| bright and clear. What a haul I made    |
| that day! I went and shot the maximum I |
| tied them to my bumper and The game     |
| laws would allow: I drove them home     |
| somehow, Two game wardens, seven        |
| hunters, Two game wardens, seven        |
| hunters, And a cow. And a cow.          |
|                                         |
| The Law was very firm, it People ask me |
| how I do it Took away my permit-- And I |
| say, "There's nothin' to it! The worst  |
| punishment I ever endured. You just     |
| stand there lookin' cute, It turns out  |
| there was a reason: And when something  |
| moves, you shoot." Cows were out of     |
| season, and And there's ten stuffed     |
| heads One of the hunters wasn't         |
| insured. In my trophy room right now:   |
|                                         |
